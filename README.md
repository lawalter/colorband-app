# How to Make an R Shiny Electron App 

*In progress*

A setup guide by L. Abigail Walter
<br>Instructions adapted from <a href="https://www.travishinkelman.com/post/deploy-shiny-electron/">Travis Hinkelman</a> 
<br>R Shiny Electron template created by <a href="https://github.com/dirkschumacher/r-shiny-electron">Dirk Shumacher</a>

<b>Motivation:</b> In February 2020, I was unable to create an app using an R Shiny Electron template via Dirk Shumaker's <a href="https://github.com/dirkschumacher/r-shiny-electron">original repo</a> or Travis Hinkelman's <a href="https://github.com/hinkelman/r-shiny-electron">fork</a>. I bypassed this issue of ```npm``` reporting dozens of warnings ond vulnerabilities by installing elecron locally with ```npx```.

<b>Objective:</b> Write a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in creating an R Shiny Electron app. This guide assumes the user has intermediate R coding skills, intermediate ability to use the terminal, and little to no experience with JavaScript.

## Getting started on macOS
All of the following steps can be run exclusively in the RStudio terminal

### Steps to get your computer ready:

1. Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Install Electron and Electron Forge using npm (npm is installed with Node.js)
    - In the terminal, type ```install -g electron-forge``` 
    - If that didn't work, try ```npm i -g @electron-forge/cli```
    - If there's a permission error, run ```sudo npm i -g @electron-forge/cli```
3. Check your versions of node ```node -v``` and npm ```npm -v```. For this guide, I will be using <b>node v13.9.0</b> and <b>npm v6.13.7</b>. If your installations do not match mine and you experience problems with these steps, try downgrading or upgrading (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below).
4. Open an existing R project or create a new one.
5. Make sure your directory is in R project folder you're ready to turn into an app. Run ```pwd``` on the command line to check what directory you are in. If you're not in the right folder, change your directory using ```cd```
  
## Advanced steps
  
### Start here if you already have node, npm, and electron installed:

6. In your project directory, install electron locally by running ```npx create-electron-app appNameHere```. Replace appNameHere with whatever you want to name your app. <b>Note:</b> Your app cannot be titled 'app'.
7. Move or add files to your new app folder, including:
- get-r-mac.sh 
- add-cran-binary-pkgs.R
- start-shiny.R
- Make new folder 'shiny' for: 
    - shiny/app.R 
- Delete auto-created contents of folder 'src', and replace with:
    - src/failed.html
    - src/helpers.js
    - src/index.css
    - src/index.js
    - src/loading.css
    - src/loading.html
    - src/main.js
8. Change your directory to your new app folder ```cd appNameHere```
9. Install R locally:
    - First, check the version of R on your machine. In the R console, run ```version``` 
    - Edit get-r-mac.sh or get-r-win.sh, replacing version numbers in the link ```https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.4.2.pkg``` with the version you are running. 
        - <b>Important:</b> The R version used to make the shiny app and the version installed locally must match.
    - Once you save the file, run the shell script in the terminal for ```sh ./get-r-mac.sh``` 
10. Get packages for R that are used in the shiny app by running ```Rscript add-cran-binary-pkgs.R```
11. Add additional dependencies to package.json. Replace the dependencies listed at the end of the script with the following. Take care not to paste over the final ending bracket ```}``` of the .json file.
```      
      "dependencies": {
        "axios": "^0.19.2",
        "electron-squirrel-startup": "^1.0.0",
        "execa": "^4.0.0"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "@babel/core": "^7.8.4",
        "@babel/plugin-transform-async-to-generator": "^7.8.3",
        "@babel/preset-env": "^7.8.4",
        "@babel/preset-react": "^7.8.3",
        "@electron-forge/cli": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "@electron-forge/maker-deb": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "@electron-forge/maker-rpm": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "@electron-forge/maker-squirrel": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "@electron-forge/maker-zip": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "electron": "8.0.1",
        "eslint": "^6.8.0",
        "eslint-config-airbnb": "^18.0.1",
        "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.20.1",
        "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "^6.2.3",
        "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.18.3",
        "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^2.4.0",
        "esm": "^3.2.25",
        "fs-extra": "^8.1.0"
      }
```
<b>Note:</b> Modules are updated frequently and as such are subject to changing version numbers. It is important to double-check that these dependencies are up-to-date by replacing their version numbers with any newer version numbers by manually searching the module names on https://www.npmjs.com/

12. Specify the ```"lint": "echo \"No linting configured\""``` line in package.json with ```"lint": "eslint src --color"```
13. Run ```npm install``` to add new dependencies you listed in package.json to the node_modules folder
14. Test to see if your app works by running ```electron-forge start```
15. If it runs, package and create the .exe on the command line with ```electron-forge make```. Your app can be found in the /out folder.

## Getting started on Windows
Unlike the macOS setup, Windows will require the use of multiple terminals, which are specified at each step

### Steps to get your computer ready:

1. Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
    - Check the box option during the node.js install to also install chocolatey
2. Skip this step if chocolatey is installed. If chocolatey has <b>not</b> been installed:
    - Open Windows PowerShell with right-click option "Run as Administrator" 
    - Follow the installation steps on the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">chocolatey</a> website
3. Using chocolatey, install innoextract:
    - Open Windows PowerShell with right-click option "Run as Administrator" 
        - <b>Note:</b> If you just installed chocolatey in Windows PowerShell, you need to close and re-open the admin shell
    - Run ```choco install innoextract``` 
4. Install <a href="https://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>
    - During Cygwin install, <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/693284/wget-command-not-working-in-cygwin">select wget packages</a> at the 'packages' screen by clicking the arrow in the 'new' clolumn to select the newest version.
5. Install Electron and Electron Forge using npm (npm is installed with Node.js)
    - In Windows PowerShell, run ```npm install -g electron-forge``` or ```npm install --save-dev electron```
6. Check your versions of node ```node -v``` and npm ```npm -v```. For this guide, I will be using <b>node v13.9.0</b> and <b>npm v6.13.7</b>. If your installations do not match mine and you experience problems with these steps, try downgrading or upgrading (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below).
7. Open an existing R project or create a new one.
8. Make sure your directory is in R project folder you're ready to turn into an app. Run ```pwd``` on the command line to check what directory you are in. If you're not in the right folder, change your directory using ```cd```
  
## Advanced steps
  
### Start here if you have all of the dependencies installed:

9. In your project directory, install electron locally by running ```npx create-electron-app appNameHere``` in Windows PowerShell. Replace appNameHere with whatever you want to name your app. <b>Note:</b> Your app cannot be titled 'app'.
10. Move or add files to your new app folder, including:
- get-r-win.sh
- add-cran-binary-pkgs.R
- start-shiny.R
- Make new folder 'shiny' for: 
    - shiny/app.R 
- Delete auto-created contents of folder 'src', and replace with:
    - src/failed.html
    - src/helpers.js
    - src/index.css
    - src/index.js
    - src/loading.css
    - src/loading.html
    - src/main.js
11. Change your directory to your new app folder ```cd appNameHere```
12. Install R locally:
    - First, check the version of R on your machine. In the R console, run ```version``` 
    - Edit get-r-win.sh, replacing version numbers in the link ```https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.6.2-win.exe``` with the version you are running. 
        - <b>Important:</b> The R version used to make the shiny app and the version installed locally must match.
    - Open the Cygwin terminal. Change your directory by typing ```cd``` and dragging the app folder to the terminal window to paste the file path. Your path will look something like ```/cygdrive/c/Users/Abby/Desktop/git/r-shiny-electron-app/appNameHere```
    - In Cygwin, run ```sh ./get-r-win.sh```
13. Switch to the RStudio terminal. Get packages for R that are used in the shiny app by running ```Rscript add-cran-binary-pkgs.R```
14. Add additional dependencies to package.json. Replace the dependencies listed at the end of the script with the following. Take care not to paste over the final ending bracket ```}``` of the .json file.
```      
      "dependencies": {
        "axios": "^0.19.2",
        "electron-squirrel-startup": "^1.0.0",
        "execa": "^4.0.0"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "@babel/core": "^7.8.4",
        "@babel/plugin-transform-async-to-generator": "^7.8.3",
        "@babel/preset-env": "^7.8.4",
        "@babel/preset-react": "^7.8.3",
        "@electron-forge/cli": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "@electron-forge/maker-deb": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "@electron-forge/maker-rpm": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "@electron-forge/maker-squirrel": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "@electron-forge/maker-zip": "^6.0.0-beta.49",
        "electron": "8.0.1",
        "eslint": "^6.8.0",
        "eslint-config-airbnb": "^18.0.1",
        "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.20.1",
        "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "^6.2.3",
        "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.18.3",
        "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^2.4.0",
        "esm": "^3.2.25",
        "fs-extra": "^8.1.0"
      }
```

## Troubleshooting 

- To change your version of node (i.e. downgrade), install program 'n'. This program will let us downgrade node if there is an issue running it at the most up-to-date version. In the terminal, run ```sudo npm install -g n``` to install and then ```sudo n stable``` to upgrade to the latest version of n. For example, to change to node v10.16.3 run: ```sudo n 13.9.0```
